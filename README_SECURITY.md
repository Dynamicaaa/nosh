# NOSH Security Documentation

## Overview

`nosh` is a security-focused shell designed with a defense-in-depth approach.  It incorporates several security features to protect data, prevent common attacks, and provide tools for monitoring system security. This document outlines the security features, their implementation details (with references to the source code), and best practices.

## Security Features

### XNU Hardened Mode

XNU mode enhances security for sensitive operations, providing an "incognito" mode for the shell.

*   **Command History Protection:** Commands executed in XNU mode are *not* logged or added to history, preventing any trace of sensitive operations.
*   **Command Sanitization:** Prevents shell metacharacter injection attacks. Potentially dangerous characters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `` ` `` (backtick), `$`, `>`, and `<`) are replaced with spaces. Note that redirection using `2>` (stderr redirection) is specifically *allowed* for error handling.
*   **Alias Isolation:** Disables alias substitution to prevent potential command hijacking.
*   **Path Traversal Protection:** Blocks attempts to use `../` patterns to access parent directories, preventing directory traversal attacks.
*   **File Permission Enforcement:** Only allows execution of files owned by root or the current user, providing an additional layer of security.
*   **Command Auditing:** Unlike regular mode which logs to command_history.log, XNU mode does not log any commands to maintain maximum privacy.
*   **Terminal Clearing:** Automatically clears the terminal screen (including scrollback buffer) upon exiting.
*   **Persistence:** The XNU mode setting (enabled/disabled) is stored persistently between sessions in the `~/.nosh_xnu_mode` file. This ensures consistent security behavior.

To enable/disable XNU mode:

```bash
# Enable XNU mode
nconfig xnu true

# Disable XNU mode
nconfig xnu false
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **`builtins.c`:**  The core logic for XNU mode resides here.
    *   `enable_xnu_mode()`: Toggles XNU mode on/off and updates the `~/.nosh_xnu_mode` file using `update_xnu_mode_file()`.
    *   `is_xnu_mode_enabled()`:  Returns the current XNU mode status.
    *   `load_xnu_mode()`: Loads the XNU mode state from the `~/.nosh_xnu_mode` file at shell startup.
    *   `handle_builtin()`:  Checks `is_xnu_mode_enabled()` before performing actions that are restricted in XNU mode (e.g., accessing history, using aliases).
*   **`executor.c`:** Implements core security checks:
    - `contains_path_traversal()`: Detects path traversal attempts
    - `check_command_security()`: Enforces XNU mode restrictions
    - `sanitize_command()`: Sanitizes dangerous shell operators
    ```c
    // In executor.c
    static char* sanitize_command(const char* input) {
      char* sanitized = strdup(input);
      if (!sanitized) return NULL;

        // In XNU mode, replace potentially dangerous shell operators
        if (is_xnu_mode_enabled()) {
          for (char* p = sanitized; *p; p++) {
            // Remove shell metacharacters that could be used for command chaining/injection
            if (*p == ';' || *p == '|' || *p == '&' ||
              *p == '`' || *p == '$' ||
              (*p == '>' && *(p-1) != '2') || *p == '<') { // Allow 2>
                *p = ' ';
              }
          }
        }

        return sanitized;
    }
    ```
*   **Configuration:** All security features are enabled by default through the `xnu_config` structure:
    ```c
    static struct {
        int block_path_traversal;     // Block ../../../ patterns
        int enforce_file_perms;       // Check file permissions
        int restrict_net_access;      // Restrict network access
        int audit_enabled;            // Enable audit logging
        int xnu_enabled;             // Enable XNU mode
    } xnu_config = {1, 1, 1, 0, 0};   // Security on, audit and XNU off by default
    ```

### Secure File Wiping

The `wipe` command securely erases files, making data recovery significantly more difficult.

1.  **Zero-Fill Overwriting:** The file's contents are overwritten with zeros. This prevents simple recovery using file undeletion tools.
2.  **Block-Wise Operation:**  Data is written in blocks (currently 4096 bytes) for efficiency.
3.  **Filesystem Unlinking:** After overwriting, the file is unlinked (deleted) from the filesystem.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **`builtins.c`:** The `handle_secure_wipe()` function implements the `wipe` command.

    ```c
    // In builtins.c - handle_secure_wipe function
    int handle_secure_wipe(int argc, char **args) {
      // ... (argument and file type validation) ...

        const int BLOCK_SIZE = 4096;
        char *zeros = calloc(1, BLOCK_SIZE); // Allocate a buffer of zeros
        if (!zeros) {
          close(fd);
          perror("wipe: calloc");
          continue;
        }

        // Overwrite file with zeros
        printf("Securely wiping %s (%ld bytes)...\n", args[i], (long)size);
        for (off_t offset = 0; offset < size; offset += BLOCK_SIZE) {
          ssize_t to_write = (size - offset < BLOCK_SIZE) ? (size - offset) : BLOCK_SIZE;
          if (write(fd, zeros, to_write) != to_write) {
            perror("wipe: write");
            break;
          }
        }

        free(zeros);
        close(fd);

        // Finally, unlink (delete) the file
        if (unlink(args[i]) != 0) {
          perror("wipe: unlink");
        } else {
          printf("File %s securely wiped and deleted.\n", args[i]);
        }
    }
    ```

### Password Manager (Citrus)

The `citrus` password manager provides secure storage for credentials, using strong encryption and key derivation.

*   **AES-256-GCM:**  Passwords are encrypted using AES in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with a 256-bit key.  GCM is an *authenticated encryption* mode, meaning it provides both confidentiality (encryption) and authenticity (protection against tampering).
*   **Argon2id Key Derivation:** The master password is not used directly as the encryption key.  Instead, it's passed through the Argon2id key derivation function.  Argon2id is a modern, memory-hard key derivation function designed to resist GPU-based cracking attacks.
*   **Random Salt & IV:**  A unique, randomly generated salt is used for key derivation, and a unique, randomly generated initialization vector (IV) is used for each encryption operation.  This ensures that even if the same password is used for multiple services, the resulting ciphertext will be different.
*   **Secure Memory Handling:**  The master key is cleared from memory after use (using `memset`) and when the shell exits.  This minimizes the window of opportunity for an attacker to extract the key from memory.
*   **Tamper Detection:**  GCM's authentication tag provides tamper detection.  If the ciphertext or associated data (in this case, none) has been modified, decryption will fail.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **`cobalt.c`:** This file contains the core cryptographic functions.  It uses the mbed TLS library for AES-GCM and Argon2.
    *   `cobalt_derive_key()`: Derives the encryption key from the master password and salt using Argon2id.
    *   `cobalt_encrypt()`:  Encrypts data using AES-256-GCM.
    *   `cobalt_decrypt()`:  Decrypts data using AES-256-GCM.
*   **`password.c`:** This file handles the password manager's user interface, file format, and interaction with `cobalt.c`.
    *   `initialize_password_manager()`: Sets up the password manager, including creating the data file (`~/.nosh/citrus.dat`) and prompting for the master password (if it's the first run).
    *   `unlock_password_manager()`: Prompts for the master password and derives the encryption key.
    *   `store_password()`: Encrypts and stores a password.
    *   `retrieve_password()`: Retrieves and decrypts a password.
    *   `list_passwords()`: Lists the stored services and usernames (but not the passwords).
    *   `clear_master_key()`:  Zeros out the master key in memory.

```c
// In cobalt.c
int cobalt_derive_key(const char* password, const unsigned char *salt, unsigned char* key) {
    // Use Argon2 for key derivation
    if (argon2id_hash_raw(2, 1 << 16, 1, password, strlen(password), salt, COBALT_SALT_SIZE, key, COBALT_KEY_SIZE) != ARGON2_OK) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

int cobalt_encrypt(const unsigned char *plaintext, size_t plaintext_len,
                  const unsigned char *key, unsigned char *ciphertext,
                  unsigned char *iv, unsigned char *tag) {
    mbedtls_gcm_context gcm;
    mbedtls_entropy_context entropy;
    mbedtls_ctr_drbg_context ctr_drbg;
    const char *pers = "aes_gcm";

    mbedtls_gcm_init(&gcm);
    mbedtls_entropy_init(&entropy);
    mbedtls_ctr_drbg_init(&ctr_drbg);

    if (mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed(&ctr_drbg, mbedtls_entropy_func, &entropy, (const unsigned char *)pers, strlen(pers)) != 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    if (mbedtls_gcm_setkey(&gcm, MBEDTLS_CIPHER_ID_AES, key, 256) != 0) { // Use 256-bit key
        return 0;
    }

    // Generate random IV
    if (mbedtls_ctr_drbg_random(&ctr_drbg, iv, COBALT_IV_SIZE) != 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    if (mbedtls_gcm_crypt_and_tag(&gcm, MBEDTLS_GCM_ENCRYPT, plaintext_len, iv, COBALT_IV_SIZE, NULL, 0, plaintext, ciphertext, COBALT_TAG_SIZE, tag) != 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    mbedtls_gcm_free(&gcm);
    mbedtls_entropy_free(&entropy);
    mbedtls_ctr_drbg_free(&ctr_drbg);

    return 1;
}
```

### Network Security Tools

`nosh` provides a set of built-in commands for basic network security monitoring and analysis.  These tools use system utilities (like `netstat`, `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `/proc/net/tcp` on Linux, etc.) to gather information.  They are *not* replacements for dedicated network security tools, but they provide a quick way to check for common issues.

*   `network ports`: Checks for open ports on the local system (localhost).  It attempts connections to common ports and reports if they are open.
*   `network connections`: Displays active network connections, similar to the `netstat -an` command.  It shows established TCP connections.
*   `network suspicious`:  Checks for unusual network connection states (e.g., SYN_SENT, FIN_WAIT1, TIME_WAIT).  This can help identify potential port scanning or other suspicious activity.
*   `network scan`: Performs a basic network security scan, including:
    *   DNS configuration check (reads `/etc/resolv.conf` on Linux/macOS).
    *   Routing table check (using `netlink` on Linux, `GetIpForwardTable` on Windows, and `sysctl` on macOS).
    *   Unusual listening ports check (checks for ports listening on non-localhost interfaces).
*   `network interfaces`: Shows information about network interfaces, including IP addresses, netmasks, and status (up/down).
*   `network firewall`:  Checks for the presence of common firewall software (iptables, ufw, firewalld on Linux; Windows Firewall on Windows; macOS Firewall). It does *not* provide a comprehensive firewall configuration analysis.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **`network.c`:**  This file contains the implementations of the `network` commands.  It uses a combination of direct system calls (e.g., `socket`, `connect`, `getifaddrs`, `GetIpForwardTable`) and, where necessary and appropriate, calls to external commands via `popen` (e.g., `netstat`).  The use of `popen` is carefully controlled to minimize security risks.

```c
// In network.c
// Check open ports on the local system
int check_open_ports(void) {
    // ... (setup) ...

    // Check common ports
    int common_ports[] = {21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 143, 443, 465, 587, 993, 995, 3306, 5432, 8080, 8443};
    int num_ports = sizeof(common_ports) / sizeof(common_ports[0]);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_ports; i++) {
        // Create a socket
        sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

        // ... (set non-blocking, address setup) ...

        // Try to connect
        if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(addr)) == 0
#ifndef _WIN32
            || (errno == EINPROGRESS || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) // POSIX non-blocking connect errors
#else
            || (WSAGetLastError() == WSAEWOULDBLOCK || WSAGetLastError() == WSAEINPROGRESS) // Windows non-blocking connect errors
#endif
            ) {

            // ... (wait with select, check for connection) ...
        }
    // ... (close socket, cleanup) ...
}

// Check for unusual connection states (simplified example)
int check_suspicious_activity(void) {
// ... (setup, platform-specific checks) ...
#ifdef __linux__
    FILE *fp = fopen("/proc/net/tcp", "r");
  // ... read and parse /proc/net/tcp
#elif defined(_WIN32) || defined(__APPLE__)
    FILE *fp = popen("netstat -an | grep TCP", "r"); // Basic cross-platform netstat command, filter in C
#endif
}

```

### Audit Logging

The shell supports optional audit logging of all commands:

- Disabled by default for privacy
- Can be enabled persistently with `nconfig audit true`
- Can be enabled for single session with `./nosh --audit`
- Logs stored in `~/.nosh/audit.log`
- Log format: `[timestamp] CMD: command | RESULT: success/failure`
- Not available in XNU mode for security

**Implementation Details:**

```c
static void audit_log(const char *cmd, const char *result) {
    if (!xnu_config.audit_enabled) return;
    // ... logging implementation
}
```

### File Integrity Verification

The shell provides built-in file integrity verification using SHA-256 hashes:

*   **Hash Generation:** Creates cryptographic hashes of files using SHA-256
*   **Secure Storage:** Stores hashes in `~/.nosh/integrity/` with restricted permissions
*   **Verification:** Checks files against stored hashes to detect modifications
*   **Cross-Platform:** Works consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows

**Implementation Details:**

*   **`integrity.c`:** Contains the core integrity verification functions:
    *   `verify_file_integrity()`: Verifies a file against its stored hash
    *   `generate_file_hash()`: Generates and stores a new file hash
    *   `calculate_file_hash()`: Computes SHA-256 hash using mbed TLS
*   **Storage Format:**
    *   Hashes stored in `~/.nosh/integrity/<filename>.hash`
    *   Each hash file contains 32-byte SHA-256 hash
    *   Directory permissions set to 0700 (owner-only access)

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Generate hash for important file
integrity gen /etc/passwd

# Verify file hasn't been modified
integrity verify /etc/passwd
```

### Security Configuration

The `nconfig` command provides granular control over security features:

```bash
nconfig <feature> <true/false>
```

## Security Design Principles

*   **Defense in Depth:** `nosh` employs multiple layers of security:
    *   **User Interface:** XNU mode provides a secure environment for sensitive operations.
    *   **System Level:** Secure file wiping protects data at rest.
    *   **Cryptography:** The password manager uses strong encryption and key derivation.
    *   **Network Monitoring:** The `network` commands provide awareness of the system's network state.
*   **Least Privilege:**  `nosh` attempts to follow the principle of least privilege:
    *   Sensitive operations are isolated (XNU mode).
    *   The password manager only unlocks when needed.
    *   The shell itself doesn't require root privileges (except for some `network` command functionality that might need it on certain systems).
*   **Secure by Default:**
    *   Strong cryptographic defaults (AES-256-GCM, Argon2id).
    *   Secure file wiping (zero-fill).
    *   Command sanitization in XNU mode.
    *   Memory clearing.

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Master Password Protection

*   The master password for the password manager is *never* stored directly.
*   It's used to derive the encryption key using Argon2id.
*   The salt is stored in the `citrus.dat` file, but the derived key exists only in memory while the password manager is unlocked.
*   The master key is cleared from memory using `memset` when it's no longer needed and when the shell exits (via the `cleanup_on_exit` function registered with `atexit`).

### Password Storage Format

The `~/.nosh/citrus.dat` file has the following format:

1.  **16-byte Salt:**  Used for master key derivation.
2.  **Entry Records (repeated for each stored password):**
    *   `size_t service_len`: Length of the service name.
    *   `size_t username_len`: Length of the username.
    *   `char service[service_len]`: The service name (e.g., "github").
    *   `char username[username_len]`: The username.
    *   `size_t data_len`:  Length of the *encrypted* password data.
    *   `unsigned char ciphertext[data_len]`: The encrypted password.
    *   `unsigned char iv[COBALT_IV_SIZE]`: The 12-byte IV (Initialization Vector).
    *   `unsigned char tag[COBALT_TAG_SIZE]`: The 16-byte authentication tag.

This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of passwords. The lengths are stored explicitly to avoid buffer overflows.

### Encryption Process

1.  **Key Derivation:** The master password and salt are used with Argon2id to derive the 256-bit AES key.
2.  **IV Generation:** A unique, 12-byte IV is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (mbed TLS's `ctr_drbg`).
3.  **Encryption:** The password is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with the derived key and IV.
4.  **Tag Generation:**  AES-GCM automatically generates a 16-byte authentication tag.
5.  **Storage:** The salt, service name, username, ciphertext, IV, and tag are written to the `citrus.dat` file.

### Decryption Process

1.  **Key Derivation:**  The master password and stored salt are used with Argon2id to re-derive the encryption key.
2.  **Data Retrieval:** The ciphertext, IV, and tag are read from the `citrus.dat` file.
3.  **Decryption:**  The ciphertext is decrypted using AES-256-GCM with the derived key, IV, and tag.  The `mbedtls_gcm_auth_decrypt` function automatically verifies the tag.  If the tag is invalid (meaning the data has been tampered with or the key is incorrect), decryption fails.
4.  **Output:** If decryption is successful, the plaintext password is made available (and, in the `retrieve_password` function, printed to the console).

## Memory Protection

*   **Limited Exposure:** Sensitive data (passwords, the master key) is kept in memory for the shortest possible time.
*   **Explicit Clearing:**  `memset` is used to clear sensitive data from memory after it's no longer needed.  This is done in `clear_master_key()` and in the `cleanup_on_exit()` function.
*   **Static Buffers (where possible):**  Where feasible, static buffers are used to avoid dynamic memory allocation (and potential memory leaks).  However, for variable-length data (like passwords and usernames), dynamic allocation is unavoidable.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Input is carefully validated and sanitized to prevent buffer overflows and other memory-related vulnerabilities.

## Password Input Security

*   **No Echoing:**  Password input is handled using platform-specific methods to disable echoing to the terminal:
    *   **Windows:**  `_getch()` from `conio.h` is used to read characters one at a time without echoing.
    *   **Unix-like systems:** The `termios` API is used to temporarily disable the `ECHO` flag on the terminal.  `tcgetattr` gets the current terminal settings, `new.c_lflag &= ~ECHO;` disables echoing, and `tcsetattr` applies the changes.  The original settings are restored afterward.
*   **Direct Memory Handling:**  The password is read directly into a buffer, and there are no unnecessary copies.

## Environment Security

### Configuration Security

*   **Protected Storage Locations:** Configuration files are stored in the user's home directory (`~/.nosh/`) to limit access.
*   **Permissions:** The `.nosh` directory and the `citrus.dat` file are created with restricted permissions (0700, meaning only the owner has read/write/execute access).
*   **Secure Parsing:** Configuration files are parsed carefully to avoid vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows when reading lines).

### Secure Directory Creation

```c
// In password.c
char *home = getenv("HOME");
if (!home) return;

// Ensure .nosh directory exists
char nosh_dir[PATH_MAX];
snprintf(nosh_dir, sizeof(nosh_dir), "%s/.nosh", home);
mkdir(nosh_dir, 0700);  // Create with restricted permissions (owner only)
```

### Command Execution Security
* **Sanitization:** The executor sanitizes commands in xnu mode
* **Expansion:** The executor uses a safe implementation of environment variable and wildcard expansion
* **Argument Handling:** The `handle_builtin` and `execute_command` functions use `strtok_r` for safe tokenization of input strings, avoiding potential buffer overflows that could occur with the standard `strtok` function.
* **Path Traversal Prevention:** `nosh` does not have specific features to prevent an attacker from using a command such as 'cat ../../../etc/passwd' to access secure files.

## Best Practices for Users

### General Security

1.  **Use XNU mode (`xnu` command or `./nosh --xnu`) when handling sensitive information.**  This is crucial for protecting passwords, API keys, and other confidential data.
2.  **Clear history (`clear-history` command) after sensitive operations,** especially if you've temporarily disabled XNU mode.
3.  **Use `wipe` instead of `rm` for sensitive files.**  Remember that `rm` only unlinks the file; the data may still be recoverable.
4.  **Choose a strong, unique master password for the password manager.** This password is the key to all your stored credentials.
5.  **Regularly scan for network security issues using the `network` commands.**

### XNU Mode Usage

Use XNU mode whenever you are:

*   Accessing sensitive systems (e.g., servers, cloud accounts).
*   Handling credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
*   Performing administrative tasks.
*   Entering or displaying confidential information.

### Password Manager

*   Use a strong, unique master password.  Do *not* reuse this password anywhere else.
*   Store all sensitive credentials in the password manager.
*   Do *not* use the shell history for quick access to passwords (this defeats the purpose of the password manager).
*   Run `citrus init` when first installing the shell to initialize the password manager.

### Secure File Operations

*   Use `wipe` for *any* file containing sensitive information.
*   Be aware that standard `rm` does *not* securely erase file contents.
*   Be aware that SSD drives require special handling for secure erasure (due to wear leveling).  `wipe` provides a basic level of protection, but it's not a guaranteed solution for SSDs.  For highly sensitive data on SSDs, consider using full-disk encryption.
*   Consider encryption for highly sensitive files, even *in addition to* secure wiping.

### Network Security Management

*   Run regular network scans with `network scan`.
*   Check for open ports with `network ports`.
*   Monitor suspicious connections with `network suspicious`.
*   Verify firewall settings with `network firewall`.

## Technical Limitations

1.  **Physical Access:** XNU mode cannot prevent someone with physical access to your terminal from seeing what you type *before* you press Enter.  It also cannot prevent shoulder surfing.
2.  **Secure Wiping (SSDs):**  Secure wiping is less effective on SSDs due to wear leveling and over-provisioning.  `wipe` provides some protection, but full-disk encryption is the best solution for SSDs.
3.  **Network Security Tools:** The `network` commands are basic diagnostic tools. They are *not* replacements for dedicated security software like intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls.
4.  **Password Manager:** The security of the password manager ultimately depends on the strength of the master password.  A weak master password can be cracked, compromising all stored credentials.
5.  **Terminal Emulators:** Some terminal emulators may have their own history mechanisms that are outside the control of `nosh`.
6.  **Path Traversal:** The current version of `nosh` does not prevent against Path Traversal attacks.

## Threat Model

`nosh` is designed to protect against:

1.  **Casual Snooping:** Preventing others from viewing your command history or screen content after you've finished working.
2.  **Credential Theft:**  Protecting passwords and other sensitive information stored in the password manager.
3.  **Command Injection:** Preventing attackers from injecting malicious commands into your shell.
4.  **Network Reconnaissance:** Providing basic tools to detect suspicious network activity.
5.  **Data Leakage:**  Preventing sensitive data from remaining on disk in a recoverable form.

`nosh` does *not* protect against:

1.  **Kernel-Level Attacks:**  If an attacker has compromised your kernel, they can bypass all shell-level security measures.
2.  **Hardware Keyloggers:**  A hardware keylogger can capture everything you type, including passwords, regardless of shell security.
3.  **Sophisticated Memory Analysis Attacks:**  A determined attacker with sufficient access to your system might be able to extract the master key from memory, even with the precautions taken by `nosh`.
4.  **Physical Access Attacks:**  If an attacker has physical access to your computer, they can potentially bypass all security measures.
5.  **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  `nosh` (like any software) may contain unknown vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Security Audit Trail

*   **Network Security Scans:**  The output of the `network` commands is displayed on the console, providing a basic audit trail of network security checks.
*   **Password Manager:**  The password manager uses authenticated encryption (AES-GCM), so any tampering with the `citrus.dat` file will be detected.  However, it does *not* log individual password access attempts.
*   **Secure Wipe:** The `wipe` command reports success or failure for each file, providing some indication of whether the operation was completed.
*   **XNU Mode:** Transitions into and out of XNU mode are clearly indicated in the prompt.

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues should be reported to the maintainers (Dynamicaaa) *immediately* and *privately*.  Do *not* disclose vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.  Include the following information:

1.  A clear description of the vulnerability.
2.  Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
3.  The potential impact of the vulnerability.
4.  (If available) Suggested mitigations or patches.

## Future Security Enhancements

Planned security improvements:

1.  **Hardware Key Support:**  Integration with hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey) for master password authentication.
2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Adding support for MFA to the password manager.
3.  **File Integrity Verification:**  Adding features to verify the integrity of system files.
4.  **Enhanced Network Security Scanning:**  Improving the `network` commands to provide more detailed and accurate security assessments.
